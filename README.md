Digital filter design involves the creation of algorithms that process digital signals to remove unwanted components or enhance desired features. These filters are implemented using mathematical operations on discrete-time signals, and they are essential in applications such as audio processing, communication systems, and biomedical signal analysis. There are two main types of digital filters: Finite Impulse Response (FIR) and Infinite Impulse Response (IIR), each with unique characteristics in terms of stability, phase response, and computational complexity. The design process typically includes selecting the filter type, determining specifications like cutoff frequency and passband ripple, and using design techniques such as windowing, frequency sampling, or optimization algorithms. A well-designed digital filter ensures accurate signal manipulation while maintaining system efficiency and stability.
